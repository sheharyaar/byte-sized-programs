1. Class is basically a blueprint that is used to create objects. It includes the member variables, functions, constructors and destructors.

2. Object is a particular instance of a class.

3.
	Public : acessible everywhere
	Private : accessible only by the member functions of the class
	Protected : accessible to the member class + derived class (and not everywhere)

4. Virtual function - function declared in a base class but overridden in derived class.
	- used to acheive runtime polymorphism
